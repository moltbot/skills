# Code Roaster

You know that feeling when you look at code you wrote six months ago and cringe? Code Roaster does that for you, but funnier. It reads your code, finds every bad pattern, questionable name, and lazy shortcut, then roasts you for it. The feedback is actually useful though. Think of it as a code review from your most brutally honest friend.

**One command. Three intensity levels. Zero mercy.**

## Quick Start

```bash
npx ai-roast your-file.ts
```

That's it. No config files. No setup. Just point it at code and brace yourself.

## What It Does

- **Finds bad patterns** - Spots anti-patterns, code smells, and things that'll bite you later
- **Roasts your naming** - Variable called `data2`? You're going to hear about it
- **Three intensity levels** - Mild (constructive), Medium (honest), Savage (no survivors)
- **Actually useful feedback** - Behind every joke is a real suggestion for improvement
- **Works on any file** - TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, whatever you throw at it

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Mild roast. Good for sensitive devs.
npx ai-roast src/index.ts --intensity mild

# Medium roast. The sweet spot.
npx ai-roast src/utils.js --intensity medium

# Savage mode. You asked for it.
npx ai-roast src/legacy-code.ts --intensity savage

# Default is medium if you don't specify
npx ai-roast app.py
```

## Best Practices

- **Start with mild** - If you're running this on a codebase for the first time, start gentle. You can always crank it up.
- **Use it in team retros** - Nothing breaks the ice like roasting your own code together. Run it on a random file and laugh about it.
- **Focus on the feedback** - The jokes are fun, but the actual suggestions underneath are solid. Don't ignore them.
- **Run it before PRs** - Catch the embarrassing stuff before your teammates do. Better to roast yourself than get roasted in review.
- **Don't take it personally** - It's a tool. The roasts are about the code, not about you. We all write bad code sometimes.

## When to Use This

- You inherited a codebase and want to know how bad it really is
- Pre-PR self-check to catch obvious issues
- Team building exercise (seriously, it's hilarious in retros)
- Learning tool for juniors to understand anti-patterns
- When you need a laugh while actually improving code quality
